            Discussions on abstract themes, many of the most extraordinary characters whose stories eventually add up to a coherent whole, sea skirmishes and plenty of black humor ... No, it's not just "Pulp Fiction", it is also a "Snatch"! Wonderful British director and screenwriter Guy Ritchie long nourishes warm feelings for his creative style of Quentin Tarantino Hollywood colleagues, putting the 1998 film "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", which became a real discovery Ritchie as cinematographer global scale. Funny description of the criminal life of London gave a real carte blanche for the director and in his next project, he has managed to collect not only the perspective of British actors, but already recognized veteran Dream Factory. Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina joined the company to Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, Vinnie Jones, Stivenu Graham and Alan Ford. And, as it turned out, to gather such an impressive casting, not necessarily wield a multi-million dollar budget. Guy Ritchie enough only 10 million, and its impeccable reputation, in order to "Snatch" saw the light. And the result of his efforts was so impressive that even though the universal appeal of his Hollywood work "Sherlock Holmes" with Robert Downey Jr. in the title role, the vast majority of viewers still associated with perky Richie criminal band of 2000!

            Very difficult to describe the plot of the movie "Snatch" in a nutshell, because the number of characters and their individual stories can meet in a couple of paragraphs. But I still try ... All the story revolves around a huge diamond that during a raid professional thief steals tetradigitate Frankie (Del Toro). Business went well and the product is already supposed to be on the way to her cousin Avi (Farina) in America, if not for one thing - Frankie was in London. And this city, ka kmy know from previous elm Richie, so just do not let go. Because in the equation to get involved with a diamond are crime boss Brick (Ford), a Russian gangster Boris Razor (Rade Serbedzija), jewelry trader Doug Head (Mike Reid), a specialist in intractable issues Tony (Jones) and nominal protagonist of the picture and in combination promoter in illegal boxing matches Turk (Steytem), together with his assistant Tommy (Graham) and the best fighter in London, gypsy Mickey (Pitt).

            Literally from the first frame "Snatch" affects ease of narration and good quick installation that Guy Ritchie has used in his best works. Despite the criminal component, the director is not shy enough to ridicule in his belt known to all the Jewish question, the mafia in the film does not shrink from close contact with boars and Roma, it turns out, is the best fighter and can give odds to any bully of the most dangerous areas of London. Richie did not forget about the fear of Western civilization to the mysterious Russian soul, giving us one of the most memorable characters in the film, Boris razors that every now and then appears in the frame under the slightly modified the tune of "Kalinka Malinka" and ready to someone's hand cut off, whether riddled with bullets. Well, no one has yet canceled gang of black criminals. But their images are unlikely to please the fans pumped gloomy crime bosses, but will delight lovers of choice of black humor!

            Entertaining can be called that indigenous Briton Richie decided to show his countrymen is a comedic side. Moreover, in his painting, they fall under the heavy hand of Boris as razors, so Roma. And this approach is only worthy of respect, because ridicule and, most importantly, to punish the vices of his nation in a tape for a wide rolled not everyone director. Moreover, Ritchie not only came under criticism, but even earned the title of a living classic of British cinema. Course director still sang the incredible coolness of the British in the image of hard brick and Tony awesome, but the benefit of that "Snatch" - a half or even more is a comedy. And all the terrible crime bosses eventually get what they deserve.

            In addition to the colorful characters and intricate plot, revolving around a single thing, Ritchie and Tarantino combines wonderfully cool (and they will not tell) musical taste. To hell with fashionable tunes! Give us the good old British classics and tunes are not for general consumption, and in fact it turns elegant composition perfectly accentuates everything that happens on the screen. However, it should be noted and the work of composer John Murphy ("28 Days Later"), which does not yield the legendary band and singers, writing a couple of tunes penetrating to the bone, especially emphasizing the incredibly tense finale.

            In the end, I want to say that about "Snatch" do not need to read a lot - it needs to look at! This is really an extraordinary spectacle, which may not be entirely clear to you from the first viewing, but be sure to re-inspire. Inexpensive statement simply is teeming with expensive stars, director's amazing finds. The film is made with the soul. Because less talk - all to view!
